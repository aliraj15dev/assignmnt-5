4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Ans: Event Delegation is a technique where instead of attaching events directly to child elements, we attach an event listener to their parent element. Then, through event bubbling, the event on the child element is detected.

Why it is useful?
i. You do not need separate listeners for each child. one parent listener handles them all.

ii. Elements added dynamically to the DOM automatically have their events handled.

iii. Using fewer listeners reduces browser memory usage.

5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
Ans : Main Different between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() is preventDefault() stop the default behavious of the form, link, checkbox, ect. And stopPropagation() stop the event bubbling or capturing.
